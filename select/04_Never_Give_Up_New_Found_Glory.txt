Living with me
I don't think it would be so bad
This is the first time this year that
I'm not going to make you mad
I'm tired of my conscious always telling me
To stop sleeping in
But I can't waste a second on dreams
That will never begin
Everyone has a head upon their shoulders
We're losing our pride as we all get older
Everyone has to pick on their saviors
You might not get it right
Or you might realize that it's too late
Don't back down
I'm over the past
Can't you see?
Don't (don't) back (back down) down
I really don't care about before
Before you met me
Is it cool if I see you tonight?
There's a thousand questions I want to ask you
If you think that is all right?
Everyone has a head upon their shoulders
We're losing our pride as we all get older
Everyone has to pick on their saviors
You might not get it right
Or you might realize that it's too late
Don't back down
I'm over the past
Can't you see?
Don't (don't) back (back down) down
I really don't care about before
Before you met me
So don't take anything for granted
Stand outside in the rain
An excuse you know I planned it
Every ending ends up the same
Don't back down
I'm over the past
Can't you see?
Don't (don't) back (back down) down
I really don't care about before
Before you met me
