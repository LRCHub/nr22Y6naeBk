There's a flickering light bouncin' off the table into your eyes
And I can't help but wanna catch it
And when you fold me in your arms
And dump your soul onto my back
All the noises in my head stop to listen
To my heart, stretchin' out
Oh, I'm givin' in
Look at this love of ours
Now, I do believe I'm settlin' in

Come on in, honey, the deep end is callin'
Touch your toes now and spring back up
I'm gonna promise it all true lovin'
So come on
Come on baby I said
Never give up

When without a warning you walked right in
Sat yourself inside me and ordered
Never has it been so easy to just lay still and let somebody see me
My heart is stretchin' out
Oh, I'm givin' in
Look at this little love of ours
I do believe I'm slowin' down a little and settlin' in

Come on in honey the deep end is callin'
Touch your toes now and spring back up
I'm gonna promise it all true lovin'
Come on
Come on baby, I said
Never give up

The first week was like a month stranded on an island
Nothin' but our bodies talkin'
And when I came up for air
All the world was there
I swear it was raining just in our honor
I was stretchin' out and oh, I'm givin' in
Oh look at this love of ours, now
I do believe I'm settlin' in
Look at this love of ours, now
I do believe we're settlin' in

Come on
Come on in honey the deep end is callin'
Touch your toes now and spring back up
I'm gonna promise it all to true lovin'
Come on in honey the deep end is callin'
Touch your toes now spring back up
Let's promise it all each other
Come on, come on, honey I said
Never give up
