You fought so hard but you have lost it
Your life's kicked in the dirt
Like it never was, like you were not born
It's over and out

Never let yourself get stuck in fears,
Use your power (use your power)
Never let it get you down, no way,
Use your power (use your power)

Living without any hope is like you're almost dead

And life will give and take it away from you
Take it all away
A storm will blow you from this place
Never give up
And destiny, it's waiting in darkness though
Let it have it's way
You're laughing in the devils face
Never give up

You're not alone, there's so many like you
Freedom will have its price
The fire in you, that glows in the ashes
Is burning still hot

Now you take your time and not your life,
Use your power (use your power)
Feel the force, you've got it all inside,
Use your power (use your power)

If you don't help yourself noone else will ever do

And life will give and take it away from you
Take it all away
A storm will blow you from this place
Never give up
And destiny, it's waiting in darkness though
Let it have it's way
You're laughing in the devils face
Never give up
